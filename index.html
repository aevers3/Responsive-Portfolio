        <p>I graduated from Bloomsburg University in 2013 with a Bachelor's Degree in English. I was hired and worked
            in publishing for the next several years. Although I was initially hired as an editor, my time at the
            company exposed me to the Adobe Creative Suite and gave me my first experience working with simple front
            end code. Until this point, I'd never considered myself a "computer person," but I started realizing that
            while coding can seem daunting, it's not impossible to learn and understand. With this mindset, I started
            to enjoy code more over time.</p>
        <p>After some varied results in teaching myself to code proficiently, I enrolled in the Penn LPS Coding Boot
            Camp to build onto my limited coding skill set. Upon completion of the program, I'll be seeking a job that
            will allow me to further develop my skills and knowledge.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I like to play music and have been a guitarist and bassist for most of my life. Other
            hobbies of mine include cooking, watching movies, and training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Regardless of the
            activity, I really enjoy learning about the things that interest me. I consider myself a lifelong learner
            in both my professional and personal lives.</p>
